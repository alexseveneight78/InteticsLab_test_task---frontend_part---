# InteticsLab_test_task---frontend_part--- (HTML5+CSS3+JavaScript) 
<p>A sandbox for the project is here (Pug+SCSS+JavaScript) - https://codepen.io/alexseveneight/pen/OJLZyoX </p>
Some notes: 

1. There are 2 workers and everyone has to pass an authorisation before his work shift. 
Please, enter one of 2 datas to enter an application:

    <ol>
      <li>First Name: Bill</li>
      <li>Last Name: Holden</li>
      <li>Login: CoolGuy</li>
      <li>Password: best90</li>
    </ol> 
    ______________________________
    <ol>
      <li>First Name: Garry</li>
      <li>Last Name: Bayern</li>
      <li>Login: admin</li>
      <li>Password: qwerty</li>
    </ol>
      
I used localStorage to simulate some of actions with database. There are already 3 clients in the localStorage: Jackie Chan, Jason Statham, Alexandr Lukashenko. The most informative is a card of Jason Statham. 

2. Spent time: from 11th to 23th of September, excluding week-end, ~3 hours per a working day. 

3. Due to the fact that I knew about this test only on 10th of September, I didn't have enough time to finish it with a 100%-functionality, usability and no bags. I'm sorry for this!  

4. The next task is to make it with Vue.js (+FireBase as a database) that I learn for the moment.
